  utter_tmax_solution:
  - text: Unplug and re-plug the {object} cable back into the PC, then restart your Salon Tracker App and see if it pulls through your timers. If you’re still having issues with it connecting, restart the {object} and then restart Salon Tracker again.
  utter_printer_connect_solution:
  - text: If you unplug your {machine_type} and plug it back it, this can often create a copy of the {machine_type} on your PC. If you go to the admin section on Salon Tracker then to the hardware tab under the {machine_type} section you may see multiple copies of the {machine_type} in your drop down. To find out which is the active copy, open ‘Printers & Scanners’ in your settings, you should see ‘idle’ next to the one that’s currently active. Set this as the {machine_type} in Salon Tracker and you should now be able to print.
